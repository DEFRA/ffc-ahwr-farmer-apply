        This website is run by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. 
        For example, that means you should be able to:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li> change colours, contrast levels and fonts </li>
          <li> zoom in up to 300%[sample accessibility statement says 400% - is there a reason why it doesn't apply to this service?] 
            without the text spilling off the screen 
          </li>
          <li> navigate most of the service using just a keyboard </li>
          <li> navigate most of the service using speech recognition software </li>
          <li> listen to most of the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver) </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the service text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        This website is partially compliant with the 
        <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA</a> standard due to the non-compliances listed below.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content<h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">
        The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.<br/>

          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations<br/>
            When entering the sign-in page, the Customer Reference Number field is in focus. This appears after other content.  
            This requires users to navigate backwards to content earlier in the document.
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            This fails WCAG 2.2 Success Criterion 2.4.3 (Focus Order).

          <p class="govuk-body">
            The sign-in page also does not contain a ‘skip to main content’ link. 
            This means users can’t bypass content such as the header and navigation.
