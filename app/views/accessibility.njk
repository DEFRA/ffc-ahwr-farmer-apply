        This website is run by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. 
        For example, that means you should be able to:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li> change colours, contrast levels and fonts </li>
          <li> zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen  
          </li>
          <li> navigate most of the service using just a keyboard </li>
          <li> navigate most of the service using speech recognition software </li>
          <li> listen to most of the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver) </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
