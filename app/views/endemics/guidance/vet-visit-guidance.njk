            <p>
              This is the first part of the service which will help asess the health and condition of your livestock.
               You must have an agreement in place before the vet visits your farm to carry out a livestock health and welfare review or endemic disease follow-up.</p>
            <h2 id="livestock-health">How it works</h2>
            <ol class="steps">
              <li>
                <p>Visit your farm and take samples for the recommended testing of the one livestock type that you’re
                  having reviewed:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) in dairy and beef cattle</li>

                  <li>porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Advise on the health and welfare of these livestock - examples could include lameness or body
                  condition.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Give you a written report after the review, including recommended follow-up actions or other observed
                  symptoms or condtions.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Give you a summary of the review that you can use as evidence if the Rural Payments Agency (RPA)
                  requests it when you claim.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="what-a-review-can-include" class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-3">How long the review takes</h3>
            <p>There’s no set amount of time for a review, but it’s likely to take between 2 and 3 hours of your time and the vet’s time. You may ask the vet to spread it over several regular visits to the farm or do it in a single visit.</p>
            <h3 id="how-the-review-works" class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-3">Discuss the health and welfare of your livestock</h3>
            <p>
              You should discuss any issues on your farm and the vet can make recommendations on how to help and what to do next.
               Examples may include reviewing biosecurity and medicine usage, and discussing any disease concerns you have. Your vet can advise you on what to focus on.
            </p>
            <h3 id="during-the-review" class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-3">During the review farm visit</h3>
            <p>
              During the visit, you must ask the vet to carry out sampling for the required testing, and to give you health and welfare advice about your livestock.
               You may also discuss topics such as biosecurity or medicine usage.
