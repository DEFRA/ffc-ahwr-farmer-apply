        <h2 id="what-the-review-is" class="govuk-heading-m">What the review is</h2>
    
        <p class="govuk-body">The annual health and welfare review of livestock is designed to help farmers:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>test for endemic diseases or the effectiveness of medicines to treat worms in sheep</li>
          <li>increase animal productivity</li>
          <li>improve animal welfare</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">You may be asked by a farmer to carry out a review. It is not an inspection or audit and is optional.</p>


        <h2 id="who-can-take-part" class="govuk-heading-m">Who can take part</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">A farmer is eligible for a funded review if they keep any of the following:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>11 or more beef or dairy cattle</li>
          <li>21 or more sheep</li>
          <li>51 or more pigs</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body govuk-inset-text">A farmer can have one agreement for a review every 10 months for one eligible type of livestock.</p>
        

        <h2 id="arrange-a-review" class="govuk-heading-m">Arrange a review</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">The farmer will contact you to arrange a review.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">There’s no set amount of time for a review, but it’s likely to take between 2 and 3 hours of your time and the farmer’s time.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The farmer can agree with you to spread the review over several regular visits to the farm or do it in a single visit.</p>       
        
        <p class="govuk-body">They’ll give you their agreement number. You will need to include it in the review summary they will ask you for it after you have done the review. You must give the summary sheet to the farmer, as they cannot claim without it. You must carry out testing after the farmer’s agreement start date and before they claim, or the farmer will not be eligible for payment.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-inset-text">The farmer must make sure the review is completed and they claim their funding within 6 months from the date they accepted their agreement offer.</p>

        <h2 id="what-farmer-will-ask-you" class="govuk-heading-m">What a farmer will ask you to do</h2>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">To receive funding, a farmer will ask you to visit their farm and:</p>
        
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>test their livestock to the recommended standards listed in the table below</li>
          <li>advise on the health and welfare of the livestock you’re reviewing</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="govuk-body">You and the farmer may also choose to discuss biosecurity, medicine usage or both if it’s useful. This is optional.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The review is flexible, so you can focus on what’s important for the farm.</p>
        

        <h3 id="required-testing" class="govuk-heading-s">Required testing</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">Depending on the species, the farmer will ask you to carry out the following testing:</p>

        </ul>

        <div class="govuk-body govuk-inset-text">
          You should carry out testing after the farmer’s agreement start date and before they claim. The farmer’s claim will be rejected if they use results from tests completed outside this timeframe.
        </div>

        <p class="govuk-body">The farmer cannot use other accreditation scheme test results for this review funding or ask you to test for other medical conditions or diseases as part of the review.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">They can use the review test results for other accreditation schemes they’re a member of. They should also check with the accreditation scheme that they’ll accept testing from the review.</p>


        <h3 id="advise-on-health-and-welfare-livestock" class="govuk-heading-s">Advise on the health and welfare of the livestock</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The farmer will ask you to advise on the health and welfare of the livestock you’re reviewing. Examples may include reviewing biosecurity and medicine usage and discussing any disease concerns the famer has.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) advises you to work with the farmer to improve the health and productivity of the animals. You could discuss easy wins and more ambitious targets to improve health and welfare.</p>

        
        <h3 id="review-biosecurity" class="govuk-heading-s">Review biosecurity (optional)</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The farmer may ask you to review biosecurity measures, explain the benefits of good biosecurity and give recommendations for improving it.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">For external biosecurity, this could include:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>purchasing policies</li>
          <li>farm visitors and vehicles</li>

        <p class="govuk-body" target="_blank">You could direct the farmer to some of the <a target="_blank" rel="external" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/Contents/Item/Display/53637">species-specific biosecurity resources on the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) (opens in new tab).</a></p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Biosecurity assessment and advice will be a required component of the endemics programmes when they become available in 2024. The farmer may prefer to do a complete biosecurity assessment as part of their enrolment in those schemes, You may want to consider this when doing your review visit on the farm.</p>


        <h3 id="review-medicine-usage" class="govuk-heading-s">Review medicine usage (optional)</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The farmer may ask you to review farm medicines, including how to prescribe and use them.</p>

          <li>evidence the review took place</li>
        </ul>


        <h3 id="written-report" class="govuk-heading-s">Written report</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The report should be a specific report for the review.</p>
